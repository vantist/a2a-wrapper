# Changelog

## 1.5.0 — 2026-05-13

### Minor Changes

- **A2A Sub-Agents** — new `subAgents` config section lets the parent agent expose remote A2A agents as MCP tools to the OpenCode LLM. The wrapper spawns [`a2a-mcp-skillmap`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/a2a-mcp-skillmap) as a stdio MCP server and registers it under the reserved `a2a-subagents` key. Each remote skill becomes a callable tool the LLM can dispatch like any other MCP tool. See `agents/multi-agent/` for an example.
- **Pinned skillmap version** — the synthesized MCP entry invokes `npx -y a2a-mcp-skillmap@<pinned>` rather than the unpinned package name, so a future skillmap release cannot silently change semantics.
- **JSON schema for `config.json`** — `schemas/agent-config.schema.json` is now generated from the TypeScript types via `npm run schema`. Editors that read `$schema` references will autocomplete and validate config files. Two test guardrails ship in CI: one validates every bundled example against the schema, one regenerates the schema from the types and asserts byte-equality with the committed copy so drift is caught at PR time.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @a2a-wrapper/core@1.5.0

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- **Memory Persistence** — agents can now declare `memory.instructions` and `memory.skills` in their config.json. At startup, the executor materializes these files into the workspace at backend-specific paths. The target path is determined by the configured model: Claude models → `CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/skills/`, Codex models → `.codex/` + `.agents/skills/`, all others → `.opencode/instructions.md` + `.opencode/skills/`.
- **configDir injection** — the CLI now automatically derives and injects `configDir` from the config file path, enabling relative path resolution in memory configs.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @a2a-wrapper/core@1.4.0

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- **Event Transport Integration** — executor now routes all trace events (tool calls, reasoning) through the new `@a2a-wrapper/core` event transport abstraction instead of calling `publishTraceArtifact` directly. Supports A2A sideband (default), HTTP collectors, and custom transports.
- **Agent card delegates to core** — `buildAgentCard()` now delegates to `@a2a-wrapper/core`'s shared implementation, eliminating duplicated card construction logic.
- **OpenCode SDK upgrade** — upgraded `@opencode-ai/sdk` from `1.3.13` to `1.4.3`. Renamed `FileDiff` → `SnapshotFileDiff` to match the new SDK export.

### Patch Changes

- **Default events config** — defaults now include `events: { enabled: true, transport: "a2a" }`.
- Updated dependencies
  - @a2a-wrapper/core@1.3.0

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix post-release bugs: Node 22 ESM resolution (postinstall patch for vscode-jsonrpc), auth error message clarity (GITHUB_TOKEN guidance), README corrections (message/\* method names, messageId in examples), and ResultManager race condition (publish task event before status-update in both executors).
- Updated dependencies
  - @a2a-wrapper/core@1.2.1

### Changed

- Migrated to monorepo structure with npm workspaces, Turborepo, and Changesets

## [1.0.0] - 2025-02-23

### Added

- A2A v0.3.0 protocol implementation over Express HTTP server
